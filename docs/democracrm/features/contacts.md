# Features: Contacts

Managing contact information is a vital part of both organizing and lobbying activities, so having comprehensive tools
for contact management in DemocraCRM is essential. To keep contact information as fresh as possible across the platform,
contacts are centralized, and those contacts can be linked to other records to add context while ensuring
that all contact records provide the same accurate information.

## Contacts

Contacts are generic contact information records for individuals, similar to a business card, that need to be managed.
Once a Contact is created, it can then be used in various "contexts" within the Organization Account. For instance, if
you receive a prospective volunteer's information, you would record that as a Contact, perhaps add it to the
"New Recruits" Contact Group (see below), and have your volunteer coordinator reach out.

If the prospect expresses interest in joining by creating a User Account, a Person record would be created, which is
used to further manage people directly involved in your organization, such as volunteers or members. As part of that
Person record, the original Contact record would be linked to the Person record.

## Contact Roles

Contact Roles define the functionary role of a Contact in a particular context. So for instance, when you are lobbying
lawmakers, it is helpful to have contact information for their key staff as well when scheduling meetings or providing
updates on lobbying efforts. Contacts can be created for each individual and linked to the Public Official record for
a lawmaker, and given a role such as "Chief of Staff" or "Scheduler."

## Contact Groups

Contacts can be organized into Contact Groups, which themselves can then be organized into hierarchies of Contact
Groups. So for example, if you need to group all the vendors you use for a particular service, you can do so, and
that vendor group can be added under a more general group of vendors you use.

In addition, Contacts can be included in multiple Contact Groups, so if a contact helps your organization in different
capacities, they can be added to each specific group and referenced within that context. The key thing to remember here
is that there is still only one Contact record to manage, which will keep all Contact Groups updated.
