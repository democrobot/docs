# Introduction

DemocraCRM is an open source, purpose-built public affairs and advocacy platform designed for supporting grassroot
efforts to pass pro-democracy, anti-corruption laws everywhere, for everyone.

## The Purpose

It's main goal is to advance reform efforts through **organizing** and **lobbying** for legislative changes. The organizing
functionality centers around recruiting, engaging, and activating people in specific reform campaign activities, and
the lobbying functionality centers around targeting officials and voters, performing advocacy efforts, and tracking
progress on proposed legislation that meets the campaign objectives.

DemocraCRM differs from other common activism CRMs such as [NationBuilder](https://www.nationbuilder.com) and
[Action Network](https://actionnetwork.org) because it focuses specifically on practices and processes dedicated to
getting legislation passed. While these other services provide excellent value for many groups, we needed a specific
set of tools to do our jobs as effectively as possible and could quickly evolve with our needs.

## The Platform

!!! info

    The docs are in a very early stage of development, with many areas just being placeholders at this point. To
    get a quick sense of the planned functionality, start with the [list of features](features/overview.md).

Many additional features are being developed to support these efforts by making the platform a collaborative place for
organizations to share information and work together towards common legislative goals. Each organization will have a
workspace account where its activities are performed within, and platform users can join workspaces
and participate in those organizations' efforts. This is similar to [Slack](https://www.slack.com), for example.

Organizations can share and collaborate on data and content together, such as on a piece legislation that is
mutually beneficial to each's reform goals. They will also benefit from centralized data and services that the platform
provides, freeing them up to focus on what they do best.

## The People

DemocraCRM is currently being developed by a team within [March on Harrisburg](https://www.mohpa.org), a
Pennsylvania-based nonprofit with a mission to "Make Corruption Illegal and Take our Democracy to Where Itâ€™s Never
Been." Our hope is to recruit allied organizations to help build this platform into something that empowers everyone
working towards that same goal, in every state in the US and possibly beyond.
